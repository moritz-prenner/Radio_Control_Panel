# Radio_Control_Panel
Turning knobs in a virtual cockpit with a mouse can be pretty painful. Thats why I made a DIY Radio Control Panel for Flight simming.
With it you can change the frequency of the radio, set your squawk and you even got a currently unbound switch that you can use.
The 7 segment displays display information and help you fly better.
